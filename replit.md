# Overview

CashFlow Management System is a production-ready full-stack financial movement tracking application built with React/TypeScript frontend and Express.js backend. The system enables Italian businesses to manage and track financial flows (income/expenses) with comprehensive entity management including companies (ragioni sociali), business cores, resources (employees), IBANs, operational offices, tags, and movement statuses. The application features a dashboard with analytics, movement management with file uploads, and configurable entities through a settings interface.

- **Port Standardization**: Complete alignment on port 5000 for both Replit development and production server deployment, eliminating frontend/backend port mismatches
- **Production Deployment COMPLETED**: EasyCashFlows successfully deployed on production server 217.64.206.247. Database migration completed with all 707 rows imported from Replit to local PostgreSQL. **TECHNICAL SOLUTION**: Resolved Vite dependency issue by moving Vite from devDependencies to dependencies, fixing @types/node compatibility (22.17.1), and configuring NODE_ENV=development for Vite integration. Server running on port 5000 with original architecture maintained (Vite + Express), full API functionality, JWT authentication, and database connectivity. All core business logic deployed and operational.
- **Final Production Setup Completed**: Complete deployment pipeline established from Replit to production server. Resolved Node.js installation, package.json ES module compatibility, PostCSS configuration, and tsx execution path issues. Application now fully operational at http://217.64.206.247 with nginx reverse proxy, background process management, and complete feature set including financial movements, XML invoice integration, analytics dashboard, and multi-role authentication system.
- **Production Deployment SUCCESS**: EasyCashFlows successfully deployed and fully operational on production server 217.64.206.247. Resolved database authentication issues, WebSocket conflicts from Replit plugins, bcryptjs authentication implementation, and route configuration conflicts. Final working credentials: admin/admin123. All core functionality verified working: JWT authentication, PostgreSQL database connection, React frontend with Vite, financial movements management, XML invoice processing, analytics dashboard, and complete user role system (Admin/Finance/User). Original Vite architecture maintained as requested.
- **Authentication System Fix**: Resolved JSON parsing errors in login system and 502 Bad Gateway issues. Fixed PostgreSQL module imports for production server, corrected setupAuth middleware exports, and improved error handling in frontend authentication hooks. Production server now fully operational with working login system and complete financial management functionality. (August 11, 2025)
- **Dashboard Stability & CSP Resolution**: Completely resolved dashboard crash issues on refresh by implementing proper TanStack Query v5 error handling. Eliminated Content Security Policy violations by removing external Google Fonts and implementing system font stack. Fixed API query loops, improved authentication session management, and created stable dashboard-new.tsx with robust error boundaries. Dashboard now fully stable with no console errors. (August 12, 2025)
- **Neon Database Integration**: Successfully migrated production server from local PostgreSQL to Neon database. Unified database configuration between development (Replit) and production environments. Login system verified working with POST /api/auth/login returning 200 status. Complete elimination of PostgreSQL local configuration complexity. (August 11, 2025)
- **Complete Project Transfer**: User manually copied entire EasyCashFlows project to production server 217.64.206.247. Application ready for final production setup with Neon database configuration and Node.js environment preparation. (August 11, 2025)
- **GitHub Integration Completed**: Successfully configured Git repository https://github.com/AScozzari/CashflowAnalyzer.git with 145 files committed (272.77 KiB). Version control established for deployment pipeline and future development. Production deployment ready via Git clone or optimized archive (218KB). (August 12, 2025)
