## Strategic Planning Sessions (August 2025)

### Multi-Tenant Analysis
**Feasibility**: Possible but highly complex (70-80% codebase impact)
- Database multi-tenant with tenant_id approach most viable
- Requires complete rework of authentication, database layer, API routes
- **Recommendation**: Complete core features first, consider separate instances for large clients instead
- **User Decision**: Deferred pending business need validation

### Modular System Architecture 
**Feasibility**: High - much more practical than multi-tenant (30-40% impact)
- Feature flags + conditional rendering approach
- Super admin panel for module activation/deactivation
- **Identified Modules**: Core Base, Financial Management, Communications, Banking Integration, AI Assistant, Document Processing, Backup System, Advanced Analytics
